**Experience	**( ~ 4 years)

**SUNY Research Foundation - A2IL (Graduate Research Assistant)	March  2022 - Present_**



* **_Chart Infographic Data Extraction  - Extracting data from line chart images_**
    * Improved accuracy of **data extraction** by 12% in multi-line chart images by modeling it as a Graph Min-Cost flow problem, analogous to **Multi-Object Tracking** and solved using **Linear Programming**.
    * Isolated background grid lines in chart images, and segmented chart lines of different styles (solid, dashed, etc.) using **Local Binary Patterns** and Color Histogram features.
    * Developed a pipeline for generating synthetic degradations to digital chart images using Image Processing to mimic noises in archived document images.

**Publication**: _LineFormer - Rethinking Line Chart Data Extraction as Instance Segmentation (Under Review) [International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR) 2023](https://icdar2023.org/)_

**Karza Technologies_ (Data Scientist - Computer Vision)	April 2020 - January  2022 (1.8 years)_**



* **_Robust Document Text Recognition & Script Classification:_**
    * Reduced Text Recognition **Character Error Rate** by **11%**, by making the model invariant to different image distortions using synthetic feature supervision & **spatial transformer networks.**
    * Improved accuracy of the Script Classification model by **8%** by using an auxiliary text recognition loss, also resulting in **better generalization** on out-of-domain text images.
* **_Document Quality Estimation_:**
    * Developed a system to evaluate OCR-suitability of an image based on several parameters such as Blurriness, Noise, Resolution etc. using Deep Learning and Image Processing.
* **_ML Deployment, Optimization and Security_**: 
    * Increased throughput and **reduced inference time** by **10-15%** for several Deep Learning models serving more than 10K requests/day in production using **TensorRT **inference engine, and other techniques like model quantization, batch inference, etc.
    * Developed scripts for **securing ML models** using obfuscation** **for deployment on mobile apps.

**_	_**

**Artivatic Data Labs (Computer Vision Engineer)	August 2019 - March  2020 (8 months)_**

*  Developed a template-based Handwritten-Forms data extraction pipeline involving **Image Registration**, **Denoising, Word Recognition, **all optimized for mobile deployment.

**Barclays Bank_ (Graduate Analyst)	July 2018 - August  2019 (1 year)_**



*  Contributed to the development of a Robotic Process Automation framework, by identifying desktop GUI elements (buttons, scrollbars, text boxes) using Image Processing and OCR.

**Academic Projects**


---

**_American Sign Language (ASL) Recognition	April 2022_**



* Modeled a Deep CNN for classification of ASL words from acoustic signals captured as spectrogram images and obtained a test accuracy of 93.5%

**_Pitchfork Music Rating Prediction	March 2022_**



* Used music meta-data data for predicting pitchfork review score using **Decision Tree Regression**, exploring **feature selection** using Lasso on, and interpreting them to identify key factors influencing review score.

**_Volunteered Distributed Computing Architecture (VoDCA)	Smart India Hackathon 2018_**



* Proposed a system for utilizing public compute nodes for scientific computation tasks like Aerial Image Stitching.
* Explored distributed execution of **Image stitching** pipeline, involving - Feature Extraction (SIFT, SURF), Matching, Homography & Image Blending.
